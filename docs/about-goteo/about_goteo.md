# About

Goteo is a platform for crowdfunding or collective financing (monetary contributions) and distributed collaboration (services, infrastructures, microtasks) for projects.  Apart from giving individual rewards, projects launched on the Goteo platform also generate collective returns through building the commons, open code and/or free knowledge. As a member of the network, you can have one or more roles: presenting new projects, collaborating with existing projects or co-funding as many as you like. [Goteo.org](goteo.org) is one of the few crowdfunding platforms in the world that has released its code under a free license, which encourages knowledge sharing across projects that publish campaigns.
